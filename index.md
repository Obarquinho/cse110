# Hello!
## I am
### Ryan Vanny
I am currently a *Software Engineering Intern* at **General Atomics**. As a programmer, most of my experience is with the student organization [Triton Unmanned Aerial Systems](https://tuas.ucsd.edu/), working on backend structures of our Ground Control Station. I additionally have a website project I'm working on with a friend called [Neat Natcher](https://github.com/Obarquinho/neatnatcher). If technologies are relevant, here a few I'm familiar with:<br>
- Golang
- Python, Django and Flask
- Docker<br>

In my free time, I enjoy cycling, working on bikes, sleeping, and doing car stuff. Recently, I bought a 2001 Mustang because I wanted an American V8.

It drives like a boat and is what I expected. If you care about HP figures:
> 260 hp @5250 rpm

Admittedly the power itself is pretty low for an engine of its displacement. Also given the fact that it was the 21st century and Ford was still pushing out "performance" trims with 2 valves is kind of funny to me. So why did I even buy this car? Well here are the requirements I had for the car I was looking for:
1. American manufacturer or made for the US market
2. Needlessly big
3. Inefficient

 <br> Also, the prveious part of my markdown file looked like this:

I just thought it looked really repetitive and that you should notice that.
